  Args:
    image: 3-D Tensor [height, width, channels] with the image. If dtype is
      tf.float32 then the range should be [0, 1], otherwise it would converted
      to tf.float32 assuming that the range is [0, MAX], where MAX is largest
      positive representable number for int(8/16/32) data type (see
      `tf.image.convert_image_dtype` for details).
    height: integer, image expected height.
    width: integer, image expected width.
    is_training: Boolean. If true it would transform an image for train,
      otherwise it would transform it for evaluation.
    bbox: 3-D float Tensor of bounding boxes arranged [1, num_boxes, coords]
      where each coordinate is [0, 1) and the coordinates are arranged as
      [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax].
    fast_mode: Optional boolean, if True avoids slower transformations.

  Returns:
    3-D float Tensor containing an appropriately scaled image

  Raises:
    ValueError: if user does not provide bounding box
